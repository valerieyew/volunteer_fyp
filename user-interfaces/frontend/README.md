This project has two main components â€“ the web application and the transport algorithm. We have divided the development of the web application into the frontend React application containing static web components, and the backend which comprises of the microservices:

  (1) Accounts (authentication and authorization)
  
  (2) Events (events management)
  
  (3) Community (allow for communication between event organisers and participants)
  
  (4) Transport (transport algorithm)

The transport algorithm takes the input pickup locations, destination and available bus capacities, and derives an optimised route for an event.
